\chapter{Deployment of The Astrocyte Plasticity Model in A Single Synapse
  Configuration} \label{chapter:obj2}

The goal of objective two in this work is to explore features of Astrocytes
found in Engineering and Neuroscience literature, in the context of the
simplified Model developed in Chapter \ref{chapter:obj1}. Table
\ref{able:obj2_astro_features} outlines specific features of Astrocyte and
Neuron-Astrocyte interactions that were common threads in background and related
work (see Chapter \ref{chapter:background}). These features are then tied back
to a specific configuration or operating mode of the developed Astrocyte model,
and the effects of that configuration are explored further.

\section{Pulse-Pair Integration}

One of the key features of the Astrocyte model developed in Section
\ref{section:obj1} is the detection and integration of coincident \ipt and \kp
activity. Once detected co-incident activity results in a change in Astrocyte
\ca (pulse-pair integration). Keeping that portion of the model constant on the
input side, there are a variety of effects Astrocytes are known or theorized to
have based on their internal \ca levels, which can be explored in the context of
the model developed in this work. The two main effects to be explored here are
\ca mediated synaptic plasticity and synaptic current.

Considering a situation where \ca levels are driving weight updates, pulse-pair
integration then differs from classic STDP in a few key ways. Firstly, weight
updates are delayed, and determined by the value of \ca, possibly in conjunction
with \ipt and \kp. Any weight update will depend on a series of causal or
anti-causal spiking events instead of a single event. It may also be that
plasticity is delayed until some internal criteria are met, with weigh updates
being proportional to the internal state. These types of effects are
hypothesized to increase stability of the plasticity rule, and add some
protection against noise.


\subsection{Impulse Response}
A simple approach, to driving weight updates is to apply a threshold to \ca in
order to determine when weight updates occur. This approach has precedent in
both Neuroscience and Engineering literature, and is the behavior described in
\ref{section:istp}. Equations \ref{eq:obj2:dw} and \ref{eq:obj2:ca_reset}
describe the weight update and \ca reset behavior.


\begin{align}
  d_w = H(ca - ca_{thr}) * \alpha_{ltp} + H(-ca - ca_{thr}) *
  \alpha_{ltd} \label{eq:obj2:dw} \\
  ca = ca * (1 - H(ca - ca_{thr}) +  H(-ca - ca_{thr})) \label{eq:obj2:ca_reset}
\end{align}


Figure \ref{fig:ppi:impulse_istp} depicts the Astrocyte plasticity model with
$Ca_{thr}=2.5$, $\alpha_{ltp}=1.05$ and $\alpha_{ltd}=0.95$. In contrast, Figure
\ref{fig:ppi:impulse_stp} shows the behavior of a classic STDP rule with the
same inputs and configuration. The inputs themselves consist of successive
spikes, with 1ms between each. These spikes form groups with enough time between
for neuron and Astrocyte states to decay. Each group has an additional spike
compared to the last.

Comparing these graphs, it is clear that integrating
behavior of the Astrocyte model effects the learning process
significantly. Resulting in more stable behavior, and increasing synaptic weight
due to causal, correlated inputs. The key effect here can be seen considering
what happens when there are additional input spikes after a post-synaptic
spike. In this case classic STDP would decrease the weight, the Astrocyte rule
integrates this event into \ca. Those input spikes are eventually associated
with an additional down-stream spike, forming a causal relationship and \ca is
increased. Eventually this leads to LTP, with the potential LTD events being
smoothed out.

It is important to understand the situations under which the Astrocyte model
will converge, and compare that to classic STDP. Figures
\ref{fig:ppi:impulse_fixed_istp} and \ref{fig:ppi:impulse_fixed_stp} depict
responses to a similar series of spike impulses, but in this case each group of
spikes is the same length. There is a significant difference between the
behavior in this case, with the Astrocyte model quickly converging, while
classic STDP decays slowly to $0.0$. Figure
\ref{fig:ppi:impulse_fixed_stp_diverge} shows the same simulation on a longer
timescale, showing the divergent behavior.

% Comparison with noisy inputs
Figures \ref{fig:ppi:impulse_noise_stp} and \ref{fig:ppi:impulse_noise_istp}
show the results of similar simulations, with the addition of uniformly random
noise in both cases. Observing the weight updates associated with the Astrocyte
model, there isn't a significant impact from the noise on the progression of
weight modulation. In the case of classic STDP, weight values fluctuate even
further, adding to the already unstable behavior.

% Exploration of Weight update behavior with different parameters
The established baseline thus far, is that given this repeating (possibly
ramping up) spike impulse as an input, results in stable convergent weight
change from the Astrocyte model. In contrast, classic STDP shows instability and
divergence. This is only a single configuration however, and there are many
parameters to tune.
\begin{itemize}
\item Spike association
\item Time constants
\item $dw$ factors, $\alpha_{ltp}$ and $\alpha_{ltd}$
\item Neuron threshold
\item Initial weight
\end{itemize}
