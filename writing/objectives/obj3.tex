\chapter{Extension Astrocyte Model To Multi-Synapse
  Configurations} \label{chapter:obj3}

In biology, astrocytes are observed influencing many synapses, in general,
hundreds of synapse across a single digit number of neurons. This spatial
integration is a fundamental property of astrocytes, and the response to
activity from these connected synapses is observed as a cell-level \ca
response. Taking this concept and applying it to the astrocyte model
in this work, a coordinated approach to synaptic plasticity is developed. This
approach is employed in a learning task where a multi-synapse view is critical.

\section{Synaptic Coupling}
This chapter introduces the concept of synaptic coupling. This is an
intermediate between the strictly local response that has been explored thus
far, and the slower (seconds timescale) cell-level responses directly observed
in biology. With synaptic coupling, there is a regional response to a hand-full
of synapses.  This response is fast (unlike the cell-level \ca responses),
operating at the speed of pre and post-synaptic spikes. Some in the
Computational and Neuroscience communities believe similar intermediate
astrocyte responses occur in nature, but that researchers don't have the
capabilities to observe them yet. In any case, synaptic coupling fits the common
theme of multi-level integration, and is shown to be critical in an example
learning task. Figure \ref{fig:astro:syn_coupling} shows the progression of the
astrocyte model from exhibiting a strictly local responses, to support
coupling. There are three major changes to the model from previous iterations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \ca response generated local to a synapse propagates up to the
  regional level. This is consistent with the observation of \gls{cicr} explored in
  Chapter \ref{chapter:background}.
\item At the regional level, there is some function implemented by the
  astrocyte, which directs plasticity across any connected synapses.
\item At the regional level, two additional internal signals \dser and
  \serca are introduced. These can be though of as chemical signals which can
  propagate from the regional level, down to a given synapse. They are
  responsible for triggering a weight change locally, or causing
  degredataion/re-uptake of \ipt, \kp, and \ca.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Synaptic AND Coupling}
The first function explored for multi-synapse astrocyte plasticity is logical
AND. This is implemented by a single astrocyte, influencing N synapses of a
single \gls{lif} neuron (1nNs1a). The expected behavior of an \gls{lif} neuron implementing
AND can be defined in terms of single spikes as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:logical-and-coupling}.

\asvgf{figures/AstroAndCoupling.svg}{Logical Definition for AND
  Coupling}{fig:logical-and-coupling}{0.5}

In Figure \ref{fig:logical-and-coupling} each of the blue or orange boxes
represents a spike, either pre-synaptic, or post-synaptic. Figure
\ref{fig:global-v-local-and-coupling} shows the difference between the local
astrocyte response, vs. the global response required to implement logical
AND. Without any context of the response from other synapses, a strictly local
rule isn't able to correctly converge to an AND function. In most situations
outlined, the regional control logic will need to signal the correct response to
one or more synapses.

To implement this, first the typical activity local to a synapse is considered,
see Figure \ref{fig:local-ca-global-response}. These \ca responses propagate,
and are readily available at the global/regional level. Using the \ca transients
from each synapse, the global logic determines if weights should change on a
given synapse, and if so, in what direction. To communicate the proper response
\dser (which triggers a weight change at a synapse) and \serca, (which triggers
messenger degradation and re-uptake) signals are passed from the regional
control level, to individual synapses.

  coupling}{fig:local-ca-global-response}{0.5}

In essence, all spiking activity on N synapses (for the purpose of implementing
AND) fall into one of the following categories.
\begin{itemize}
\item AND - The neuron behaved correctly, this is either $pre_0, pre_1, ...,
  pre_n \implies post_o$ or $others -> \neg post_0$ : Reset all synapses
\item Other-influence - This situation occurs when $post_o$ comes before all
  $pre_i$ inputs. This implies something happening outside the control of
  associated synapses. It doesn't make sense to change the weight in this case,
  as it is unknown why there was a $post_0$ spike. In addition, the \gls{lif} neuron
  may be in a refractory period, and it wouldn't make sense to try and update
  weights during that: Reset all synapses.
\item Early-Spike - $post_0$ occurs before some spiking inputs, but after
  others. This would indicate one or more of the input synapses have weights
  that are too high: \gls{ltd} on synapses that received inputs.
\item LPT - If input spikes arrive at $pre_0, pre_1, ..., pre_N$ and there is no
  post-synaptic spike $post_0$, this implies weight values are too low: trigger
  \gls{ltp} on all synapses.
\end{itemize}

Equations (\ref{eq:ca_and_ltp}) through (\ref{eq:serca_cases}) formalized the behavior outlined
in Figure \ref{fig:local-ca-global-response} and the list above. In the context
of this chapter, resetting of a synapse (in response to a \serca signal) means
to reset all of the variables (\ca, \ipt, \kp) to zero, which is analogous to
the breakdown and re-uptake that occurs in biological astrocytes in response to
\gls{cicr}.

\begin{align}
  ca^i_{ltp} &= ca_i > thr_{and} \label{eq:ca_and_ltp} \\
  ca^i_{ltd} &= ca_i < -thr_{and} \\
  ca^i_{ip3} &= ca_i > thr_{ltp} \\
  ca_{ltp} &= \Sigma_{i=1}^N ca_{ltp}^i \\
  ca_{ltd} &= \Sigma_{i=1}^N ca_{ltd}^i \\
  ca_{ip3} &= \Sigma_{i=1}^N ca_{ip3}^i \\
  dser &=
  \begin{cases} 
    -1.0, ca_{ltp} > 0 \land ca_{ltp} < N \\
    1.0, ca_{ip3} > 0 \land ca_{ip3} < N \\
    0.0, otherwise
  \end{cases} \label{eq:dser_cases} \\
  serca &=
  \begin{cases}
    1.0, ca_{ltp} == N \\
    1.0, ca_{ltp} == 0 \land ca_{ltd} > 0 \\
    0.0, otherwise 
  \end{cases} \label{eq:serca_cases}
\end{align}

Where $N$ is the total number of synapses for AND coupling, $ca_i$ is the
calcium concentration of synapse $i$ that has diffused from local to regional
level. \dser and \serca are the signals from regional to local level, gating
plasticity and controlling chemical re-uptake.

Which of these categories in Figure \ref{fig:logical-and-coupling} a given set
of inputs and response belongs to, depends on some model parameters. Namely,
the timing constants and thresholds $thr_{and}$ and $thr_{ltp}$. Given a
set of parameters, there is a deterministic window of time spikes must fall into
in order to be considered for a particular response. Outside this window, from
the perspective of the astrocyte, those spikes never happened. This window is
dependent on many parameters however, and possibly changes given previous
activity. Instead of solving for the exact point in time a spikes falls out of
the time window, a lower bound is defined, $\delta_{ptp}=10ms$. The astrocyte
was tuned to guarantee proper behavior if spikes fall within this
window. This implies that the time between the first pre-synaptic spike, to the
first (possibly only) post-synaptic spike must be no more than this value. With
this timing constraint a variety of pre-pre-post spiking events can be generated
in a two-synapse configuration. This experiment will remove the influence of
synaptic weights and \gls{lif} neuron dynamics, focusing solely on astrocyte
response \ca.

Figure \ref{fig:2n1a_and_response} Shows the response of a single astrocyte to
two pre-synaptic spiking inputs, and single post-synaptic spiking outputs. Spikes
can arrive in any order, or not at all. If spikes do occur, they abide by the
$\delta_{ptp}=10ms$ constraint. Though the figure shows the spiking bouts
continuous in time, the astrocyte's internal state is reset between each.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj3/astro_2s1a_and.svg}{Astrocyte with AND coupling
  response to two pre-synaptic spiking inputs, and a single post-synaptic spike
  randomly generated}{fig:2n1a_and_response}{0.4}

For the limited number of examples in Figure \ref{fig:2n1a_and_response}, the
astrocyte performs correct computations. This can be observed by comparing the
ground truth categorization of inputs (bottom plot) with the \dser and \serca
activity. For example: when the categorization is ``Early Spike'', \dser is $-1.0$ for a
single time-step, indicating \gls{ltd} on that synapse. Automating this comparison
process, an error rate can be computed, where each 10ms bout is labeled as a
match, or mis-match. A more exhaustive search, consisting
of 10,000 10ms bouts, showed zero mis-matches from the expected result,
\eq{eq:astro_2syn_exaust} shows that 10,000 iterations should be sufficient to
cover the entire input space for two synapses. Figures
\ref{fig:3n1a_and_response} and \ref{fig:4n1a_and_response} show the same success
for three and four synapses, which is supported by the 10k simulation test.

\begin{align}
  \textrm{possible AND spikes} &= \binom{11}{1}^3 = 1331 \label{eq:astro_2syn_exaust}
\end{align}

\eq{eq:astro_2syn_exaust} solves the counting problem ``How many
possible spiking configurations are'' for three synapses and a 10ms (10 discrete
1ms time steps) window. The $11^{th}$ possibility in this case, represents that a
spike does not occur on a synapse.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj3/astro_3s1a_and.svg}{Astrocyte with AND coupling
  response to three pre-synaptic spiking inputs, and a single post-synaptic spike

  response to four pre-synaptic spiking inputs, and a single post-synaptic spike
  randomly generated}{fig:4n1a_and_response}{0.4}

Though simulations thus far are a good indication of a performant astrocyte
model; Real-world applications will involve a set of continuous inputs, where
astrocyte and neuron states are maintained, not reset every 10ms. A continuous
simulation is explored next, with inputs generated by concatenating a number of
10ms bouts in time, without any resetting of astrocyte or Neuron state. In this
configuration, there are some situations where the astrocyte does not respond as
expected (a mis-match from ground truth), in general this is due to a \ca
deviation from zero, at the boundary where generated 10ms bouts are
joined. These situations made up $\approx 14\%$ of inputs, across 10,000 10ms
bouts. Figure \ref{fig:astro_2s1a_and_cont} shows some of the failure cases
encountered.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj3/astro_2s1a_and_cont_invalid.svg}{Astrocyte with AND coupling
  response to a continuous timeline of two pre-synaptic spiking inputs, and a
  single post-synaptic spike randomly generated}{fig:astro_2s1a_and_cont}{0.4}

When considering $n=3$ and $n=4$ synapses with continuous randomly generated
spiking inputs, the error rate observed is consistent with that of $n=2$. For
$n=3$ there are 283 mismatches out of 2000 10ms bouts (14.15 \% error). For
$n=4$, there are 416 mismatches out of 3000 (13.9 \% error).

By default there are some cases present in the randomly generated spike train
that are impossible in the current configuration. Namely, cases where a
post-synaptic spike precedes all pre-synaptic spikes. This would be possible
with influence from other synapses outside of the AND-coupling domain, or
through the introduction of noise into the neuron model, but those cases aren't
considered here. With the removal of such cases, the error rate increases to
23.3 \% for 2 synapses, 22.0 \% for 3 synapses, and 18.0 \% for 4 synapses. The
increased error rate indicates that they astrocyte model benefits from sparsity
in activity needing a response.

Initial simulations which have isolated the astrocyte and provided random
inputs, indicate that in a majority of cases, the astrocyte is capable of
directing plasticity correctly to implement an AND function. The
\dser and \serca signaling reflects the activity of the global AND logic, and
the polarity of \dser matches the desired weight update. A fairly consistent
error rate of between 14 \% and 24 \% is observed, which is theorized to be low
enough for proper convergence to implement AND.

Closing the loop fully, the weight update behavior outlined in equation
\ref{eq:astro_and_dw} is implemented. With that addition, an astrocyte-\gls{lif} (1n2s1a)
configuration was simulated, given the same continuous inputs generated by
concatenating 10ms bouts, but only of pre-synaptic spikes for $n=2$
synapses. Where before, post-synaptic spikes were also randomly generated, now
any post-synaptic activity is driven by an \gls{lif} neuron with synaptic weights.
The default synaptic weight is $\approx 0.7$.

\begin{align}
  dw_{syn} = ca_{syn} lr_{ltp} \textrm{ if } ca_{syn} >
  0 \label{eq:astro_and_dw} \\
  dw_{syn} = ca_{syn} lr_{ltd} \textrm{ if } ca_{syn} < 0 \\
\end{align}

  configuration, with the astrocyte directing synaptic

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:snn_2s1a_and}: Initially, synaptic weight values are
too high, and the neuron fires in response to a single pre-synaptic spike. As
expected, the astrocyte traces show \dser signals arriving at the offending
synapses, triggering \gls{ltd}. Completing the link, and allowing \ca to drive
plasticity, showed weight updates corresponding to the \dser signals and \ca
concentration. As the simulation progresses, weight values decrease, and the \gls{lif}
neuron begins to fire in response to two pre-synaptic spikes. There was a slight
over-correction, and some \gls{ltp} events occur, bringing the weights back
up. Eventually, the synaptic weights converge and offer a good approximation of
an AND function over the inputs. Looking at the bottom plot, there are two error
rate traces, labeled $+\Delta_w$ and $+\Delta_w$. These indicate example inputs
where the neuron responded incorrectly, and one or more synaptic weights neeeded
to be increased, or decreased respectively. Summing these two error rates give
an overall error rate.

Under the limited test conditions, Figure \ref{fig:snn_2s1a_and} demonstrates
success for coordinated astrocyte plasticity. This convergence to an AND
function needs further exploration. Since the coordinated plasticity was
developed to work with N synapses, it is important to evaluate other
configurations besides $n=2$.

Figures \ref{fig:snn_3s1a_and_w_dw} and \ref{fig:snn_4s1a_and_w_dw} show the
progression of learning in 3 and 4 synapse configurations respectively. In each
case, the addition of a synapse beyond 2 results in increased noise in the
convergence, towards the end of simulation. Exploring this convergence further,
initial weight values of each synapse are uniformly distributed from $0.0$ to
$2.0$. Figure \ref{fig:snn_4s1a_and_w_dw_w} shows the results, which indicate
the initial weight value does have some effect on convergence, but that overall,
a stable solution is reached given a range of initial values.

  configuration, with the astrocyte directing synaptic
  plasticity}{fig:snn_4s1a_and_w_dw_w}{0.6}

Though the learning rule converges to a degree, there is still a fair amount of
noise in the weight values as $n$ increases, and the mean error rate is upwards
of $20\%$. In order to better explain what is going on, observe the two error
rates, in the lower plots of Figures \ref{fig:snn_3s1a_and_w_dw} and
\ref{fig:snn_4s1a_and_w_dw}. There is an oscillation, between the majority of
errors involving $+\Delta W$ and $-\Delta W$. This indicates that optimal weight
values on all of the synapses, are being under and overshot repeatedly. This is
a common problem in learning rules, and is not a fundamental
drawback. Additional discussion and next steps were outlined in chapter
\ref{chapter:conclusion}.
