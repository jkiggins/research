\chapter{Adaptation of the Astrocyte Model To Multi-Synapse Configurations} \label{chapter:obj3}

\section{Summary}]
In this chapter, the developed Astrocyte model is expanded to incorporate
multiple synapses, along with the concept of a global, cell-level response. The
goal here is to explore how an additional synapse alters existing behaviors and
properties of the Astrocyte model, as well as introduce a novel cell-level
response, which helps the model to learn a desired response to a set of
inputs. This learning bout will exhibit properties not achievable with Classic
STDP in a similar configuration.
