\chapter{Development of an Astrocyte Model Sensitive to Spike Timing} \label{chapter:obj1}
The first objective of this thesis, is to develop an astrocyte-\gls{lif} model
that is capable of responding to pre and post-synaptic spike timing, and explore
how internal and external configuration affects this response. These internal
signals will eventually be used to drive synaptic plasticity, and generalize
\gls{stdp}. That theme guided the experiments in this chapter.

Though many details of chemical signaling within astrocytes are still unknown
\parencite{manninen_2018}, there are common themes to what is known both
chemically, and from bio-inspired models. These themes have potential to greatly
improve upon existing \gls{stdp}-like plasticity rules. At their core astrocytes
behave as master integrators of neural activity. They are capable of sensing
activity across many thousands of synapses simultaneously. Integrating that
activity quickly at the local level, and propagating signals to the entire cell
body, integrating over a longer time-scale. Applying this multi-level
integration approach to synaptic plasticity leads to many interesting questions
and potential benefits beyond existing local learning rules to explore.

\section{Spiking Neuron Model}
This work makes use of a Leaky Integrate and Fire (\gls{lif}) neuron model. \Gls{lif}
neurons are fairly simple computationally, relying on exponential functions
and thresholds in the functional definition. While not the most
bio-realistic (see Figure \ref{fig:sn_model_compare}), \gls{lif} neurons exhibit
rich behavior with few parameters, and are easily extended. In addition, \gls{lif}
neurons are the most widely used in \gls{snn} literature \parencite{ponulak_2011}. The
goal here, is to remain computationally simple, while still leveraging unique
features found in biology. This same approach used in the astrocyte model
definition.

\eq{eq:lif:psp}, and (\ref{eq:lif:v}) define the differential equations that
govern neuron \gls{psp} $v_{syn}$ and membrane voltage $v_{mem}$
dynamics.

\begin{align}
d_{vsyn} = -v_{syn}(t) \tau_{syn} d_t + z_{pre}(t) w \label{eq:lif:psp} \\
d_{vmem} = -\tau_{mem} (v_{mem} + v_{syn}) d_t \label{eq:lif:v}
\end{align}

Here, $z_{pre}$ represents the spiking activity on the synapse at time $t$ and
has a value of either $0$ or $1$. $w$ is the synaptic weight. $\tau_{syn}$ and
$\tau_{mem}$ are post-synaptic terminal and membrane timing constants.

The \gls{lif} neuron fires according to \eq{eq:lif:fire}, where $H$ is the
Heaviside step function, and $thr_{mem}$ is the $v_{mem}$ threshold that
triggers firing.

\begin{align}
z_{post}(t) = H(v_{mem}(t) - thr_{mem}) \label{eq:lif:fire}
\end{align}

After firing the neuron membrane potential is reset to $v_{reset}$, which is
generally a negative voltage $\leq -thr_{mem}$, see \eq{eq:lif:reset}.

\begin{align}
v_{mem}(t+1) = v_{mem}(t)(1 - z_{post}(t)) + z_{post}(t)v_{reset} \label{eq:lif:reset}
\end{align}

Figure \ref{fig:1n1s1a_fn_diagram} depicts the \gls{lif} neuron described by
equations above. Figures \ref{fig:lif:sample_1}, \ref{fig:lif:sample_2}, and
\ref{fig:lif:sample_3} shows a sample of the \gls{lif} responses to random
Poisson inputs with various parameter values. Table \ref{table:lif_params}
defines the baseline parameter values, with any differences being outlined in
the figures. In each figure, blue traces represent the \gls{psp} voltage wave,
while purple represents the membrane voltage.

Comparing Figures \ref{fig:lif:sample_1} and \ref{fig:lif:sample_2}, the neuron
seems more excitable with a higher $\tau_{mem}$. This is initially
counter-intuitive, since a higher value would result in increased decay, however
this $\tau_{mem}$ also scales the effect of the \gls{psp} on membrane voltage
(see \eq{eq:lif:v}). In addition, a larger decay factor results in decreased
recovery time for the neuron from reset. In contrast a lower value for
$\tau_{syn}$ causes the neuron to fire more often with the same input, due to
the \gls{psp} decaying more slowly.

\section{Classic STDP} \label{obj1:sec:classic_stdp}
    
The proposed astrocyte model, in the single-synapse configuration aims to
generalize \gls{stdp}, and offer some additional effects and features that are
distinct from \gls{stdp}. In order to have a point of comparison, an \gls{stdp}
implementation was chosen to use in this capacity. \eq{eq:song_classic_stdp}
defines \gls{stdp} in the context of this work \parencite{song_2000}.

\begin{align}
  F(\delta t) =
  \begin{cases} 
    Ae^{- \frac{|t_{pre}-t_{post}|}{\tau}} & t_{pre} - t_{post} \leq 0, A > 0
    \\ Ae^{- \frac{|t_{pre}-t_{post}|}{\tau}} & t_{pre} - t_{post} > 0, B < 0
  \end{cases} \label{eq:song_classic_stdp}
\end{align}

This equation is evaluated for various $\delta t$ between $-50ms$ and
$50ms$. The resulting curve is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:stdp_dw_dt}. This
functional definition is not directly implemented since there is not timeline of
spikes to work with, instead, the exponential function is approximated by
integrating Equations
(\ref{eq:song_impl_pre},\ref{eq:song_impl_post}, and \ref{eq:song_impl_dw}) over
time. Table \ref{table:classic_stdp_params} shows the
parameters used during simulation.

  A Z_{post} \label{eq:song_impl_post} \\
  F = H(Z_{pre}) trace_{post} + H(Z_{post}) trace_{pre} \label{eq:song_impl_dw}
\end{align}

Depending on the desired behavior, the $H(Z_*)$ term may be dropped from the
update Equations, this is related to the spike associations outlined in Figure
\ref{fig:astro:spike_associate}.

Figure \ref{fig:stdp_dw_dt_impl} shows a sweep of spike pairs as before from
$-50ms$ to $50ms$. This figure matches Figure \ref{fig:stdp_dw_dt}, showing that
the implementation matches the theoretical equations.

\section{Model Development}
Astrocyte model development starts with a survey of current research, and
understanding of the underlying biology of astrocyte mediated
plasticity. Astrocyte models in the literature range from computationally simple
models, which are generally paired with perceptron neurons to complex
mathematical models, which aim to mimic the calcium dynamics precisely. The
latter models are generally paired with \glspl{snn}. From the neuroscience and
engineering literature, it was possible to identify the common input and output
pathways for astrocyte-neuron interaction.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pre-synaptic \gls{glu} $\implies$ \ipt $\implies$ \ca pathway
  \item Post-synaptic depolarization \kp $\implies$ \ca pathway
  \item \ca $\implies$ D-serine release (more generally, plasticity modulation)
\end{enumerate}

\asvgf{figures/1n1s1a_diagram.svg}{Astrocyte and neuron model diagram for an \gls{lif}
  neuron with one input}{fig:1n1s1a_fn_diagram}{0.5}

Figure \ref{fig:1n1s1a_fn_diagram} outlines the developed astrocyte-\gls{lif} neuron
model, as well as the internal dynamics of the neuron. Some aspects of this
model were left undefined at first, and different configurations were explored
experimentally. These gaps are the function blocks in darker blue. The
portions of the model which were consistent throughout this work are described
first, followed by a deeper dive into the remaining functionality. The two input
pathways, which drive the state values \ipt and \kp are described by Equations
(\ref{eq:astro:spike-ip3}) and (\ref{eq:astro:spike-k+}). It should be noted, that
the astrocyte response pathways are similar in form to an \gls{lif} neuron's membrane
voltage. This decision is driven in part by a simplification on some
bio-realistic models, but also to demonstrate that key properties of astrocytes
are dependent on the pathways and relative time-constants, less then the specifics of
\ca, \ipt, or \kp dynamics.

\begin{align}
  d_{ip3} = d_t (-IP_3)\tau_{ip3} + \alpha_{ip3} z_{pre}(t) \label{eq:astro:spike-ip3} \\
  d_{k+} = d_t (-K^+)\tau_{k+} + \alpha_{k+} z_{post}(t) \label{eq:astro:spike-k+}
\end{align}

Where $\tau_{ip3/k+}$ represents a time constant for a given pathway, $z_{pre}$
is $1$ if there is a pre-synaptic spike at time $t$ ($0$ otherwise), and
$z_{post}$ is $1$ when the post-synaptic neuron fires ($0$ otherwise). For all
simulations (unless otherwise specified) $d_t = 0.001$ or $1ms$.

The \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)} and \emph{Dw(\ca)} blocks define the behavior
of the astrocyte at a synapse local level, given input from the internal state values,
which are representative of external activity. In this chapter only the internal
state of the astrocyte was considered so \emph{Dw(\ca)} is a
No-Op. For many of the astrocyte model variations explored in this chapter, a
key property is stability of the response given a set of weight
values. Stability, in this case, refers to either a lack of \ca response, or
sub-threshold \ca response. This was an important property when considering
a learning bout, as stable points represent places that learning will converge.

%% TODO: put this somewhere in Obj2
%% In general, \emph{Effect(u)} represents $d_w$ and takes the form outlined in
%% \eq{astro:dw}. Whenever the astrocyte state variable reaches the
%% pre-determined threshold the associated weight is scaled by some factor
%% $\alpha$, which may be different, depending on the direction of weight
%% change.

%% \begin{align}
%%   d_w = H(u - u_{thr}) * \alpha_{ltp} + H(-u - u_{thr}) * \alpha_{ltd} \label{astro:dw}
%% \end{align}

%% Here, $H$ is the heaviside step function, and $u_{thr}$ a constant threshold
%% applied to $u$.
    
\section{Exploring Input Pathways Responses}

In order to get some general guidelines for valid parameter ranges, it was
necessary to sweep various parameters, and explore the model's response. The parameters
used during simulation are outlined in Table \ref{table:astro_in_path_params},
with any deviations mentioned in the graph.

\begin{table}[!htp] \centering

The group of similar plots in Figures \ref{fig:astro:sweep_alpha_ip3_tau_1} and
\ref{fig:astro:sweep_alpha_ip3_tau_2} depict astrocyte responses to a common
spike pattern, with different values for $\alpha_{ip3}=\alpha_{k+}$. The
curves in these plots are scale multiples of each-other, showing that
$\alpha_{ip3/k+}$ does not effect timing, but only the scale of the astrocyte
response. The figures also indicate that small values of
$\tau_{ip3}=\tau_{k+}$ can lead to a response that diverges given constant
input, such as with $\tau_{ip3/k+} = 10$.
%% TODO: add more detail about steady-state

\section{Signed Proportional Calcium Integration} \label{sec:sign_prop}

To support a plasticity rule with \gls{stdp}-like characteristics, an astrocyte model
needs to be sensitive to the relative spike timing of pre and post-synaptic
spikes. One approach to achieve this, is to specify a \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)}
function that considers the magnitude
of input pathway state variables \ipt and \kp as well as which variable is
larger (the order). This gives a magnitude and sign to each update to the
astrocyte state variable \ca. The value of \ca will eventually leading to \gls{ltp} or
\gls{ltd} when explored in Chapter \ref{chapter:obj2}. This approach is outlined by Equations
(\ref{eq:astro:rate-u}) and (\ref{eq:astro:u-reset}), which define the change in
\ca.

\begin{align}
  T_{diff} = IP_3 - K^+ \\
  dca_{delta} = (H(T_{diff} - thr_{ltp}) - H(-T_{diff} - thr_{ltd})) |IP_3 K^+| \\
  dca_{decay} = -ca \tau_{ca} d_t \\
  dca = dca_{delta} + dca_{decay} \label{eq:astro:rate-u} \\
  \cam = \cam (1 - H(\cam - thr_{ca})) \label{eq:astro:u-reset}
\end{align}

Where $H$ is the Heaviside step function, $T_{diff}$ is the difference between
\ipt and \kp traces at some time $t$. $thr_{ltp}$ and $thr_{ltd}$ determine
the valid ranges of $T_{diff}$ for an update to \ca to occur. $dca_{delta}$
describes the change in \ca at a given time from external influence, while
$dca_{decay}$ accounts for the leaking of \ca. Note that the threshold values
determine the sign of $dca_{delta}$, and provide the ability to shift the \ca
response, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:astro:stdp_ltd_shift}. Increasing the distance
between the \gls{ltp} and \gls{ltd} thresholds also allow for varying degrees of
tolerance to transient activity that would otherwise lead to a response by the
astrocyte. Simulations use the baseline parameter values outlined in Table
\ref{table:ordered_prop_params}, with any variations or parameter sweeps
outlined in graphs.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj1/sweep_u_tau_p0.7.svg}{Response of \ca to

Figures \ref{fig:astro:sweep_alpha_u_tau_1} and
\ref{fig:astro:sweep_alpha_u_tau_2} depict the response of \ca for
different values of $\tau_{ca}$ and different spiking events. In general,
larger values of $\tau_{ca}$ result in smaller deviations in \ca overall, due
to the value decaying more quickly. With smaller $\tau_{ca}$ more of the
previous activity is integrated into the value of \ca and the response is
more broad.

Expanding on the simpler timeline plots, Figure
\ref{fig:astro:u_thr_heat_rate_vs_tau_u} shows the number of times \ca crosses a
threshold of $2.5$ for a given $\tau_{ca}$ and $r$ spiking rate for a Poisson
spike-train input. This graph can be used to tune either $thr_{ca}$ or $\tau_{ca}$
for a given application, and gives an impression of the excitability of the
model.

astrocyte effect on synaptic weight given different input poisson spike
rates, and different values of $\tau_{ca}$}{fig:astro:u_thr_heat_rate_vs_tau_u}{0.3}

\subsection{Classic-STDP and Variants} \label{sec:ordered_prop:stdp}

Using the signed proportional \ca response the astrocyte plasticity model is
capable of implementing classic \gls{stdp}, along with several variations. Figure
\ref{fig:astro:classic_stdp} shows the model's response to spike pairs with
a variety of inter-spike-interval times (X-axis). This is a typical \gls{stdp}
curve.

  and neuron model response to pulse pairs:
  baseline}{fig:astro:classic_stdp}{0.5}

The model has additional parameters beyond what a traditional \gls{stdp} rule
would have, and this offers flexibility. By providing asymmetric
$\tau_{ip3}$ and $\tau_{k+}$ the model can be bias toward \gls{ltd}/\gls{ltp}. Figure
\ref{fig:astro:stdp_ltd_bias} shows this effect for \gls{ltd}.

model response to pulse pairs: \gls{ltd} bias}{fig:astro:stdp_ltd_bias}{0.5}

In addition, threshold parameters $thr_{ltp}$ and $thr_{ltd}$ can be used to
shift activity from the \gls{ltp} to \gls{ltd} region, or vise versa. Figure
\ref{fig:astro:stdp_ltd_shift} shows this shifting behavior.

model response to pulse pairs: \gls{ltd} shift}{fig:astro:stdp_ltd_shift}{0.5}

Additional figures can be found in Appendix \ref{section:appendix-a}.

One of the main features of this model is its ability to generalize \gls{stdp},
and capture a variety of variants that have been proposed and explored in the
literature. Table \ref{table:astro_varient_params} maps specific values of
model parameters to the corresponding \gls{stdp} behavior. If that
variant of \gls{stdp} has a name from other research it is included.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Rate-based Response} \label{sec:rate_response}

When input spiking activity is sparse in time, the model behaves as outlined
in Section \ref{sec:ordered_prop:stdp} above. However, when more dense
inputs are provided, the relationship between \ipt and \kp shifts from
temporal, to rate-based. In the sparse case, \ipt $>$ \kp implies that an
incoming spike happened more recently then a post-synaptic spike. When
incoming spikes are dense in time, \ipt $>$ \kp would imply more activity on
the input side (on average) than the output. What follows, is a rate-based
internal response, where \ca responds to a difference in average activity,
subject to time constants. \eq{eq:astro:rate-u} above describes \ca
behavior. \eq{eq:astro:u-reset} outlines the reset of behavior \ca,
the value reset to $0$ when $|\cam| > thr_{ca}$.

In Figure \ref{fig:astro:rp_many-w_tl}, the middle plot shows the internal
response of an astrocyte to a random Poisson input across different weight values. In
this case, there is significant response from the astrocyte for weight values of
$2.0$, with less of a response for $4.0$. This is due to a lower firing rate out
of the \gls{lif} neuron compared to the input. Intuitively there should be a weight
value where the difference between pre and post-synaptic firing rate is
smallest. For the upper graph $w=10.0$ is close to that point, with only two
regions in the timeline with any activity.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj1/astro_rp_many-w_tl.svg}{Astrocyte response to random
  poission spike train for various synaptic weights}{fig:astro:rp_many-w_tl}{0.5}

Looking at the upper plot in Figure \ref{fig:astro:rp_many-w_tl}, the effect of
$thr_{ltp}=1.75$ and $thr_{ltd}=-1.75$ can be seen. Those parameter values form
a hysteresis band, where the astrocyte does not respond with increased \ca for
small deviations between \ipt and \kp. This leads to an increased range of
weight values resulting in stable behavior. Sweeping synaptic weight in Figure
\ref{fig:astro:rp_many_w_sweep} shows that weight values beyond $w \approx 3.0$
result in no \ca activity.

\asvgf{figures/artifacts/obj1/astro_rp_many-w_sweep.svg}{Astrocyte response to random
  poission spike train for various synaptic weights}{fig:astro:rp_many_w_sweep}{0.4}

While this effect with denser inputs is novel, and likely very useful in some
cases, the breakdown of sensitivity to spike-timing is not always a desirable
property. There may be some mitigations, involving tighter time constants
$\tau_{ip3}$ and $\tau_{k+}$, but initial simulations showed other issues with
this. In the next section, a modified \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)} is introduced, which
exhibits spike-timing sensitivity with sparse and dense inputs.

\section{Integrated Spike Timing Response} \label{section:istp}
The previous signed proportional model outlined in Section
\ref{sec:sign_prop} could exhibit sensitivity to spike timing. This was
demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:astro:classic_stdp}, where the characteristic
\gls{stdp} curve was reproduced by the astrocyte model. As shown in Section
\ref{sec:rate_response} the sensitivity to spike timing only holds for sparse
inputs.

This \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)} function is define by \eq{eq:astro:temp-u} and was
found to be sensitive to spike timing, regardless of input sparsity (or lack
thereof). Looking closer at the definition, $reset_{ip3}$ and $reset_{k+}$
parameters determine if additional spikes are added into the \ipt and \kp
traces, or override them. These parameters, along with the weight update
behavior determine which groupings of spikes result in changes to \ca. Figure
\ref{fig:astro:spike_associate} outlines possible spike association behaviors,
with the boxes representing which spikes are grouped into a \ca response. Green
boxes represent an increase in \ca (which may eventually lead to \gls{ltp}) and
red a decrease (which may lead to \gls{ltd}).

\begin{align}
  K^+ =
  \begin{cases} 
    d_{k+} & reset_{k+} = 1, z_{pre}
    \\ K^+ + d_{k+} & otherwise
  \end{cases}
  IP_3 =
  \begin{cases} 
    d_{ip3} & reset_{ip3} = 1, z_{post}
    \\ IP_3 + d_{ip3} & otherwise
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

\asvgf{figures/SpikeAssociation.svg}{A variety of spike associations
supported by the neuron-astrocyte model}{fig:astro:spike_associate}{0.5}

\begin{align}
T_{delta} = -\alpha_{ltd} z_{pre} K^+ + \alpha_{ltp} z_{post} IP_3\\
d_{ca} = -\cam \tau_{ca} d_t + T_{delta} \label{eq:astro:temp-u}
\end{align}

In this case, $z_{post}$ and $z_{pre}$ are pre and post-synaptic spikes that
the astrocyte is sensing on a single synapse. The $\alpha_{ip3/k+}$ parameters
are used to control the magnitude of influence \ipt and \kp have on astrocyte
\ca. In addition $\alpha_{ltd/ltp}$ can override default \gls{ltp}/\gls{ltd} behavior,
implementing anti-stdp, or biasing weight updates towards \gls{ltp}/\gls{ltd}. Note also,
that \eq{eq:astro:temp-u} implies astrocyte \ca will decay with each
time step, but only be influenced by \ipt and \kp when spikes occur, and
not continuously. If enough \ca accumulates from coordinated spiking events, a
threshold $thr_{ca}$ is reached and \ca reset. The baseline parameter values
for simulation are outlined in Table \ref{table:istp_params}.

The changes to \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)} introduced in this section did not diminish
the astrocyte's ability to generalize \gls{stdp} and variations. Figures that can be
found in Appendix \ref{appendix:astro_figures} show the full set of \gls{stdp}-like
simulations for both astrocyte configurations in this chapter.

A common theme when discussing astrocytes and their functional roles is one of
time-scale. Spike can occur at any time-step, and last only a single
time-step. When pairing with classic \gls{stdp}, learning can occur just as
quickly, with influence from only a single pair of spikes. This property of
\gls{stdp}, in some cases, leads to instability. As a spike pattern is presented
to a neuron, and that neuron fires, it is possible, and very likely with some
inputs, that \gls{stdp} will associate spikes incorrectly. It is a hasty
learning approach, and naturally can't predict the future. An astrocyte
plasticity model is in a good position to mitigate this. Defining a
threshold, $thr_{ca}$ which gates any external response by the astrocyte (namely
a weight update) and leads to a more patient learning process.

Figure \ref{fig:astro:ramp_impulse} shows the behavior of the temporal integration
model when a series of spike impulses are presented to the network. Each
successive pulse has an additional spike from the last and the resulting \ca
activity is depicted for a given synaptic weight. This simulation exposes the
averaging effect of the spike timing model. With an impulse of 4 spikes, the
neuron is driven enough to output a single spike, this happens around
300ms. With 4 pre-synaptic spikes and 1 post-synaptic spike, the astrocyte's \ca
is increased, exceeding the threshold of $2.5$. Subsequent spike impulses have
$>4$ spikes, which leads to a drop in \ca, due to anti-causal pairing
(transiently) of pre-synaptic spikes. Regardless of these transient drops, \ca
consistently exceeds $thr_{ca}$ throughout the
simulation.

Figure \ref{fig:astro:tp_many_w_sweep} graphs the number of times $thr_{ca}$ is
exceeded during a fixed length simulation, for a few different values of
$thr_{ca}$. For $\cam=2.5$, regions of the graph around $0.8$ and $1.2$ show
weight values that result in a stable configuration, where all \ca activity is
sub-threshold. Figure \ref{fig:astro:tp_many_w_tl} shows
a timeline of astrocyte activity for three different weight values, and
$thr_{ca}=2.5$.

This concept of sub-threshold oscillations is important, as it provides a
mechanism for astrocyte-mediated plasticity to reach a convergence point given a
set of inputs. This convergence point is dependent on the input pattern in
question, and the $\Delta \cam$ vs $\Delta t$ curve characterizing the \ca
response. Considering Figure \ref{fig:astro:tp_many_w_tl} and recalling the
shape of Figure \ref{fig:astro:classic_stdp}: The three output spikes align with
input spikes, which maximizes $\Delta t$ between the output spikes, and
neighboring presynaptic spikes in any direction. This maximal spacing leads to a
minimum \ca response. Note that spikes with $\Delta t=0$ do not elicit a \ca
response. Independent of the weight value \ca remains sensitive to activity at a
synapse. Changes in the input firing pattern may result in \ca oscillations
exceeding the threshold once more, and trigger another round of weight
updates. In this way, astrocytes can converge on synaptic weight values, but
still support continuous learning.

\section{Summary}

This chapter introduces a computationally simple and efficient astrocyte
model. This model was developed with inspiration from the many works outlined in
Chapter \ref{chapter:background}, and focuses on an astrocyte's role in synaptic
plasticity. These include neuroscience works, which outline observed and
theorized bio-chemical pathways. As well as works which present highly realistic
mathematical models of astrocyte behavior. For the astrocyte model developed in
this work, an emphasis was placed on computational efficiency, while maintaining
the common pathways pulled from the body of background research. Compared to
some of the more bio-realistic astrocyte models, a relatively small number of
parameters are used to define this model's behavior.

The literature shows considerable diversity on the main functional role(s) of an
astrocyte, as well as how a given function is achieved chemically. In this work,
with synaptic plasticity as a main functional role, a framework for astrocyte
local dynamics was developed, and is outlined in Figure
\ref{fig:1n1s1a_fn_diagram}. \emph{Ca(\ipt, \kp)} and \emph{Dw(\ca)} are generic
functional blocks which represent the gap in existing literature.

It is assumed the \ca will drive synaptic plasticity, though the exact mechanism
isn't explored in this chapter. With that in mind, two different approaches are
considered for \ca dynamics, both of which can reproduce the characteristic
\gls{stdp} curve in their \ca response, as well as common variation. It is discussed
how this \ca response could extend \gls{stdp} as a learning rule, with a focus
on temporal integration, and patience in the learning process. The two
variations on the developed astrocyte model explored, parallel the differences
between rate-based Hebbian learning, and \gls{stdp}. In both cases, it was shown
that the astrocyte can integrate neural activity over time, and that parameters
can control the time-scale of any response.

Focusing on spike timing, one of the major drawbacks to \gls{stdp} is its
inherent instability. It is well known that unchecked, \gls{stdp} will drive
synaptic weights to either minimum or maximum limits
\parencite{legenstein_2005}. One of the key features of astrocyte plasticity is
an inherent stability at non-maximal weight values. This stability was
demonstrated in both configurations outlined above, which was exhibited by
minimal and sub-threshold \ca activity. Further, with the flexibility offered,
surrounding the \ca response, these weight convergence points can be
parameterized as well.

Overall, this objective introduces a framework for astrocyte-\gls{lif} Neuron
computation, and explores two specific models geared towards synaptic
plasticity. For each of these models, synaptic weight values of an \gls{lif} neuron
(coupled with an astrocyte) are swept, and stable configurations are identified,
which represent convergence points in a potential learning rule.
