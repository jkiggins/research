\chapter{Adaptation of the Astrocyte Model To Multi-Synapse
  Configurations} \label{chapter:obj3}

In biology, Astrocytes have not been observed influencing a single synapse on a
single neuron. In general they encapsulate hundreds synapse across a single
digit number of neurons. In this chapter, single neuron, multi-synapse
configurations will be explored. Taking that small step closer to a bio-inspired
configuration, but remaining simple enough to explore fundamental properties.

%% Gating of plasticity
%%   - Only allow plasticity on synchronous inputs
%%   - The opposite of ^
  
%% Orchestration between Synapse
%%   - Don't allow multiple synapse to learn from the same post-synaptic spike (WTA
%%   Pairing)
%%   - Global learning ``pool'' Each thr event on any synapse depletes the pool,
%%   which then refills
%%   - Relative strength of plasticity


\section{Summary}
Though there is a lack of general consensus, much of the Neuroscience literature
suggests that Astrocytes have a fast local response to synaptic activity, which
is then integrated to a cell-level response. Taking inspiration from this
multiple level integration approach, the existing signals and Astrocyte behavior
are duplicated for each synapse that an Astrocyte influences. The initial goal
then, is to determine how the introduction of additional synapses effects
general behavior. At a high level, the simple \ca threshold approach to driving
plasticity is no longer stable in a 1nNs1a configuration. This is somewhat
expected, and there is a need for additional constraints for weight values to
converge. To meet this need synaptic coupling is introduced. This coupling
drives plasticity of the coupled synapses based on activity across the coupled
domain. This mimics an effect explored in Neuroscience literature, which is that
ER bodies within an Astrocyte can form pathways between synapses that don't
immediately affect the main cell body, but do influence a group of synapses. The
two coupling rules explored in this chapter are AND and NAND. As their
names suggest, these coupling rules are tied to a particular logic function. In
general, the Astrocyte will drive weight values towards implementing the desired
function, detecting behavior that is not in alignment and updating weights
accordingly.

\section{Synaptic Coupling}
In order to implement synaptic coupling in an efficient and bio-realistic way,
there are some changes to internal Astrocyte signaling, when compared to the
1N1S1A configuration. Figure \ref{fig:astro:syn_coupling} shows the progression
of the Astrocyte model to support coupling. Instead of each synapse having
separate \ipt, \kp, and \ca dynamics, the coupling rule defines the mapping of
these concentrations, and drives any resetting behavior.

\subsection{AND Coupling}

The AND coupling function is implemented across 2 or more synapses within a
single Astrocyte, and may be one of many coupling functions at work. Logically,
AND coupling can be defined by Figure \ref{fig:logical-and-coupling}.

\asvgf{figures/AstroAndCoupling.svg}{Logical Definition for AND
  Coupling}{fig:logical-and-coupling}{0.5}

In Figure \ref{fig:logical-and-coupling} each of the blue or orange boxes
represents a spiking event, consisting of one or more spikes. In the case of
multiple spikes, the synaptic weight may be tuned to be sensitive to a
particular spiking pattern, if that pattern is differentiable with a single
weight value and LIF neuron dynamics.

In order to test the Astrocyte response and tune parameters, some timing
constraints must be defined. Initially, a single timing constraint
$\delta_{ptp}=10ms$ will be used. This implies that the time between the
first pre-synaptic spike, to the first (possibly only) post-synaptic spike must
be no more than this value to ensure proper behavior. $\delta_{ptp}/2$ will be
the maximum time between any two pre-synaptic spikes. With these timing
constraints a variety of pre-pre-post spiking events can be generated in a
two-synapse configuration. This experiment will remove the influence of synaptic
weights and LIF neuron dynamics, focusing solely on Astrocyte response.
