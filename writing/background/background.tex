    \section{Spiking Neural Networks}
    Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a type of brain-inspired computing model. This class of
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the most bio-realistic that is used in
    engineering applications. They are an important topic in the machine
    learning field specifically, and have gained interest in recent years. There
    are a variety of motivations for exploring bio-inspired compute models. As
    of 2015 most papers were concerned with the low-power and parallelism
    offered by SNNs \cite{schuman_2017}. These bio-inspired models
    have distinct advantages when looking at hardware implementations, and can
    offer significantly better performance/watt when compared to traditional
    ANNs. In addition, SNNs offer a method of exploring some of the important
    features of biological neural networks that aren't yet possible to replicate
    in artificial networks. These include one-shot learning, short-term memory,
    and problems involving time-series data, where the mammalian brain excels
    \cite{kasabov_2013}.

    \todo{Add figure of SNN topology}
    
    SNNs, formed by connections between spiking neurons, are a bio-realistic
    type of artificial neural networks. In traditional ANNs real valued numbers
    propagate through the network, are multiplied and added, with activation
    functions applied at the output of each neuron. Spiking neurons instead emit
    voltage spikes. These spikes propagate across a synapse, are usually
    multiplied by a weight, and are sometimes transformed in other ways (delay,
    filtering, etc...). This transformed value is called a post-synaptic
    potential (PSP). PSPs accumulate at the neuron downstream, in the form of
    membrane voltage, or more generically a state variable. Once a certain
    threshold is reached the post-synaptic neuron fires, or emits a voltage
    spike. Since there are many Spiking Neuron models, it is necessary to
    formalize what is considered a spiking neuron. In general they process
    information from one or more inputs, and produce a single spike-like
    output. The probability of firing is increased by excitatory inputs, and
    decreased by inhibitory inputs. There is at least one internal state
    variable, and depending on this variable output spikes are generated
    (normally a threshold) \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    There are many potential models that fit the requirements of a spiking
    neuron. In addition, some models are more often paired with other
    bio-inspired components such as Astrocytes, which it is a goal of this work
    to explore. Relevant models are outlined below. These models each balance
    bio-realism with computational efficiency, with some excelling at
    both. Figure \ref{fig:sn_model_compare} shows where a number of models fall
    when measured by these criteria.

    %%%%%%%%%%%% Spiking Neuron Models %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Leaky Integrate and Fire Neurons}
    The most popular Spiking Neuron model used in the literature is by far the
    Leaky Integrate and Fire or LIF neuron. In this model the state variable is
    represented by an internal voltage, which is increased as current flows into
    the post-synaptic neuron, and charge accumulates. Current leaks from this
    internal reservoir lowering the voltage. Equation \ref{eq:lif} defines the
    behavior.
    
    \begin{align}
        C \frac{du}{dt}(t) = -\frac{1}{R}u(t)+(i_o(t) + \Sigma w_ji_j(t))
    \end{align}
    
    Once the state variable u (generally thought of as a voltage) reaches a
    certain threshold the neuron outputs a spike. After this time the state
    variable is reset, and is held at that value for a period known as the
    absolute refractory period. This mimics the behavior of biological neurons
    \cite{ponulak_2011}.

    \subsection{FitzHugh - Nagumo model}
    The FitzHughâ€“Nagumo is a common Spiking neuron model that is coupled with
    Astrocytes in a few works that will be explored later (\cite{postnov_2009},
    \cite{postnov_2007}). It is based on the highly (computationally) complex
    Hodgkin-Huxley model, with a variety of parameters fixed and others tuned to
    get different firing patterns. \cite{postnov_2009} outlines the membrane
    voltage dynamics, with a tanh activation function forming the synaptic
    coupling between neurons (or neuron and Astrocyte).

    \begin{align}
      \epsilon \frac{dv_1}{dt} = v1 - \frac{v_1^3}{3} - w_1 \\
      \frac{dw_1}{dt} = v_1 + I_i - I_{app} \\
      \tau_s \frac{d_z}{dt} = (1 + tanh(S_s(v_1 - h_s)))(1 - z) - \frac{z}{d_s}
      \\
      I_{syn} = (K_s - \delta G_m)(z - z_0)
    \end{align}

    The constant $\epsilon_1 = 0.04$ is the time-separation parameter and
    $I_1 = 1.02$ defines the operating regime as excitatory. $H_s$ and $D_s$
    control activation and relaxation of the neuron. $I_{app}$ represents the
    input to the synapse at all sources.

    \subsection{Spiking Neural Network Topologies}
    Spiking networks can take on a variety of topologies, similar to traditional
    ANNs. Feed forward, Recurrent, and a Hybrid of both. One, more specific
    hybrid is a Synfire chain, which is feed forward between sub-populations of
    recurrent networks. Within a standard feed-forward network lateral
    inhibition is often employed, implementing a Winner Take All (WTA)
    configuration. In this case a layer of neurons has feed forward connections
    from the previous layer, in addition to inhibitory connections within the
    layer. The result is the first neuron to emit a spike prevents all other
    neurons within that layer from doing so \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    Synfire chains are of particular interest, as they show a coordination
    within the spiking network. From input to output, in a feed-forward pattern,
    populations of neurons coordinate, passing along a "packet" of neuronal
    activity. It was observed in monkey's, that the precise timing of spikes was
    correlated with behavior, and synfire activity was given as a possible
    explanation \cite{aertsen_1996}.

    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% Coding Schemes %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Coding Schemes}
    With the addition of a temporal dimension in spiking neural nets, there are
    a variety of ways to encode information. The coding schemes used in research
    are generally based on observations in biology \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    Rate-based coding is based on some of the earliest observations of sensory
    neuron activity. As pressure on a tactile nerve was increased researchers
    observed an increase in firing rate of that receptor neuron. This translated
    into rate-based coding in artificial SNNs \cite{ponulak_2011}. Rate-base
    coding couldn't explain certain observations in biology however. Some
    responses were too fast for the neurons involved to estimate the firing
    rate. In addition, dynamic responses have been observed in the primary
    auditory cortex without a changing of firing rate, but instead, firing
    pattern within a sub-population of neurons. More specifically, the relative
    timing of two or more spikes can encode information. This is very
    advantageous, since a spike lasts $\approx 10^-3s$, but relative timing
    between spikes can distinguished down to $10^-8s$ \cite{ponulak_2011}. This
    greatly increases the bandwidth of communication, and theoretical minimum
    latency. The general trend, is that any neurological system where processing
    speed is especially important, will tend to rely on a spike timing based
    encoding for information.
    
    A variety of temporal coding schemes have been proposed, and
    investigated. Time to first spike, as the name suggests, encodes information
    in the latency between stimulus and the first spike. This is accomplished by
    using a neuron model that has an inhibitory feedback connection, suppressing
    additional spikes. Rank order coding (ROC) represents information in the
    order of spikes within a population of neurons, that each emit a single
    spike. This allows fast information processing, since the time between
    spikes isn't important, and can be very small. This scheme was proposed as
    an explanation for ultra-fast processing in the primate visual
    cortex. Similar to ROC, with latency coding, information is represented in
    the time between spikes of a population of spiking neurons. As with ROC,
    each neuron emits a single spike. This encoding scheme is supported by
    evidence in biological networks, where it has been observed that moving the
    timing of a  single spike by ~10ms can change downstream activity
    \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    These include rate-based coding, where firing rate over some window
    indicates activity. Time to first spike, or the latency between the start of
    stimulus and the first spike of a neuron. This has been observed in tactile
    sensing neurons in humans \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% Encoding Real Values %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Encoding Techniques}
    In general, data being presented to a SNN will take the form of a real
    value. This is true of images, sound, values from various integrated
    sensors, such as temperature or acceleration. A method is needed that can
    convert these real values into a spike, or spikes, as defined by a coding
    scheme.
    
    \subsection{Poisson Encoding/Decoding}
    A very popular method of encoding real values into spikes , or just to
    generate random spikes, is treating spikes as a Poisson process. In general,
    the rate parameter is either random, or equal to the real value being
    encoded. There are two main approaches for sampling spikes from a Poisson
    distribution. The first calculates the probability of a spike in a given
    time-step, with the real value as a firing rate. The resulting probability
    is compared to the result of sampling a uniform distribution sampled once
    for each discrete time step. If the uniformly random value is below the
    Poisson probability a spike is inserted, at that time. One potential issue
    with this, relates to numeric precision. If the simulation time step is
    small in comparison with the rate parameter, then the probability of an
    event may be quite small. Go small enough, and the uniformly random number
    won't have enough precision to ever dip below the threshold. In this case no
    spikes would be produced.
    
    \todo{ref  https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/poisson.pdf}
    
    \begin{align}
        P(k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \\ P(1) = \lambda e^{-\lambda}
        \\ spike_i = P(1) > X_i
    \end{align}
    
    The next, and more numerically stable method, is to use the exponential
    distribution, or Poisson waiting time to sample intervals between
    spikes. Interval times are randomly sampled from the exponential
    distribution.
    
    \begin{align}
      interval = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \\
      x = rand(0,1) \\
      spike_i = \lambda e^{-\lambda x_i}
    \end{align}

    $interval$ is computed repeatedly until the desired length spike train has
    been constructed.
    
    %This technique generates a spikes train as shown in the following graph.
    
%    \afig{figures/encode_poisson_sweep.png}{Poisson encoded spike train for real values between 0 and 1}{fig:enc_poisson_sweep}
    
    To determine how different operations process data within a SNN, it is
    useful to be able to decode a spike train into real values. This involves
    finding the most likely $\lambda$ parameter for given spike train. Using
    maximum likelihood estimation this is found to be the inverse of the sample
    mean.
    
    \begin{align}
        \lambda = \frac{N}{\Sigma x_i}
    \end{align}
    
    This decoding process is subject to error, which improves with sample time.
    
    \subsection{Temporal Coding}
    There are a variety of time-based (vs. rate-based) coding schemes, each
    slightly different, they each rely on precise spike timing to encode
    information. Beyond a qualification of these methods, a precise definition
    (or definitions) needs to be proposed and used during simulation.
    
    \subsubsection{Rank Order Coding}
    Information is encoded in the relative spike times within a population of
    neurons. Encoding itself is fairly straight-forward. Real valued inputs are
    transformed into spike latency, and for a given sample neurons fire
    once. Generally larger values are assigned a smaller latency, and smaller
    values a larger one \cite{delorme_2001}.
    
    Some changes to the network itself have shown success when paired with rank
    order coding. These Include a progressive desensitization, similar to the
    biological concept of shunting inhibition. Equation \ref{eq:roc_activation}
    shows the activation of a neuron, given a modulation factor
    $\alpha in (0,1)$ and a set of incoming connections $a$. Subsequent spikes along a
    given input connection have less and less of an effect on the overall
    activation of the neuron \cite{delorme_2001}.
    
    \begin{align}
        Activation(i,t) = \Sigma_{j \in [1,m]}\alpha^{order(a_i)}W_{j,i} \label{eq:roc_activation}
    \end{align}

    %%%%%%%%%%%% SNN Learning Approaches %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{SNN Learning Approaches}
    In biology, the changing of synaptic weights is referred to as synaptic
    plasticity, and is considered to be one method that facilitates learning and
    memory. Changes in plasticity can be quick, such as with pulse-paired
    facilitation (STDP-like learning) or more gradual, such as with long-term
    potentiation \cite{ponulak_2011}.
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% STDP %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity}
    One of the most widely used learning approaches employed in SNNs is Spike
    Timing Dependant Plasticity or STDP. Traditionally this is an unsupervised
    approach, and an extension of Hebbian learning. Classic Hebbian learning can
    be summed up by ``if neurons fire together, they wire together'' meaning
    correlated firing is rewarded by increased connection (or weight). STDP gets
    a bit more specific, and rewards causation. This means a connection is
    strengthened if a pre-synaptic spike is followed by post-synaptic firing,
    and weakened if a pre-synaptic spike follows post-synaptic firing. Eq
    \ref{eq:classic_stdp} describes classic STDP \cite{tavanaei_2019}.

    \begin{align}
        \Delta W =
        \begin{cases} 
          Ae^{-\frac{|t_pre-t_post|}{\tau}} & t_{pre} - t_{post} \leq 0, A > 0
          \\ Ae^{-\frac{|t_pre-t_post|}{\tau}} & t_{pre} - t_{post} > 0, B < 0
       \end{cases} \label{eq:classic_stdp}
    \end{align}

    Swapping the conditions in Equation \ref{eq:classic_stdp} leads to
    ``anti-STDP'' (aSTDP) where correlated spikes result in reduced weight. This
    is useful in some learning rules extending STDP.


    \subsection{Properties of Classic STDP}
    Classic unsupervised STDP has seen much success in pattern recognition
    tasks, but does fall short in certain areas. In general STDP converges to
    recognize repeating spatio-temporal patterns, and complex patterns can be
    recognized by a single neuron \cite{tavanaei_2019}. STDP does have trouble
    converging in order to differentiate similar (but distinct) inputs
    \cite{vigneron_2020}. STDP also tends to drive weights to favor early
    spikes, using those early spikes as the main factor in pattern
    recognition. There has been extensive statistical analysis of STDP, both due
    to it's nature, and since it is known the the brain performs Bayesian
    analysis of sensory stimuli \cite{tavanaei_2019}. As part of this analysis
    Nessler et. al in 2009 determined that STDP coupled with a WTA configuration
    of neurons, was able to implement the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
    algorithm. In addition, it has been shown that classic STDP will generally
    drive weights to either maximally inhibitory, or maximally
    excitatory. \todo{Expand stat analysis}.

    %% \todo{cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03000.pdf}.

    Traditional ANNs satisfy the Universal approximation theorem, meaning they
    can approximate any function between their inputs and outputs, arbitrarily
    well given the right topology. SNNs share this property, through their
    ability to approximate Sigmoid neurons using rate-based coding. It isn't
    clear yet whether SNNs have this property in their own right
    \cite{legenstein_2005}. When considering STDP, this raises a similar
    question, what subset of all the possible weight values can be learned using
    STDP, or STDP-like rules? \cite{legenstein_2005} explores this
    question. There are, at first glance, some holes in a universal
    approximation argument with SNs. It would be difficult to get a spiking
    neuron model to fire in the absence of any input. In addition, for a mapping
    to be learned, it must be stable. For STDP, this means the weights are
    bi-modal, with values either being at their minimum or maximum. Researches
    found that on average, a supervised variant of STDP (with teaching signal to
    force output firing) can converge to a desired weight distribution.


    \subsection{Weight Initialization}
    
    With STDP, weight initialization is an important step, which can impact SNN
    performance, and ability to learn. It is common practice to use a normal
    distribution to initialize weights. There are some pittfalls to this
    approach. If $\mu$ is too small, some weights may result in ``dead''
    synapses, which will never result in a neuron firing. Conversely choosing a
    $\sigma$ that is too large, will result in some synapses (at random)
    overpowering others, and lead to poor convergence \cite{vigneron_2020}.


    \subsection{Reward-Modulated STDP}
    
    Recently, there has been some success with a supervised variant on STDP,
    known as reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP). In this case a Deep Convolutional
    Spiking Neural Network (DCSNN) was applied to the MNIST digit recognition
    task. Early layers of the network were trained in an unsupervised manor,
    with normal STDP. Later layers were updated using reward-modulated
    STDP. That is, if the output was correct, STDP was applied. If not,
    anti-STDP was applied. This learning approach has basis in biology, with the
    reward modulation mimicking the activity Dopamine and Acetylcholine
    (ACh). As a proof of concept, researchers applied their learning method to a
    shallow network, with a single trainable layer. They used rank order coding,
    and at most one spike per neuron. The output class is determined by which
    neuron in the output layer exhibits a spike first. This architecture gave
    passable results, but wasn't well suited to multi-layer training.
    
    For their deep architecture, shown in figure \ref{fig:rstdp_dcnn} better
    results, an accuracy of 97.2\% which is on par with the state-of-the-art was
    achieved. \cite{mozafari_2018}.
    
    \afig{figures/rstdp_dcnn_arch.png}{Spiking DCNN
      Architecture}{fig:rstdp_dcnn}{0.6}

    R-STDP improves classification on similar samples, and trains the network to
    recognize discriminate features, instead of repeating ones. The result, is
    a learning rule capable of handling similar but distinct inputs.

    \subsection{ReSuMe}
    The ReSuMe learning rule is another variant of STDP, which is very similar
    to the R-STDP update rule defined by \cite{mozafari_2018}, though with some
    important differences. With ReSuMe, a single neuron and set of synapses are
    initialized with some weight values randomly. There is a 2nd similar neuron
    which implements the desired behavior. Inputs are provided to both neurons,
    and at each time step weights are updated according to the difference
    between the teaching neuron, and neuron in training. The weight update can
    be described by \ref{eq:resume_stdp}.

    \begin{align}
      \Delta w = \Delta W_{STDP}(S_{in}, S_{d}) + \Delta W_{aSTDP}(S_{in}, S_{o}) \label{eq:resume_stdp}
    \end{align}

    Where $\Delta W_{STDP}$ and $\Delta W_{aSTDP}$ are the weight changes
    associated with classic STDP behavior, and the negation of classic STDP
    behavior. In each term, the input spike is considered, but first with
    $S_{d}$ which is the desired output coming from the ideal neuron. Second,
    with the actual output \cite{mozafari_2018}. \cite{ponulak_2010} was the
    first to develop and explore this learning rule, and they were able to prove
    convergence, from an untrained neuron, to one of similar configuration with
    a desired behavior. The use of a teaching signal and the specifics of
    Equation \ref{eq:resume_stdp} creates a unique extension to classic STDP,
    where weights can be updated without the down-stream neuron firing.

    %%%%%%%%%%%% Back Propagation %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Back Propagation}
    
    Back-propagation is traditionally difficult to implement in SNNs, as the
    spike function is not differentiable. There are some shortcuts proposed,
    such as using the membrane voltage derivative instead of spike
    output. However applying backprop may not be the best approach. The brain
    doesn't (as far as is known) have a method of back-propagating errors. It
    has been proposed to adapt the network architecture to allow rewards at the
    output to affect all portions of the network. A hybrid reward-STDP approach
    shows promising results \cite{tavanaei_2019}.
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% Deeper Networks %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Deeper Networks}
    Deep learning is still largely unexplored in SNNs, as well as multi-layer
    learning in the deep architectures that have been explored. Motivating
    further exploration is both the success of deep Artifical Neural Networks,
    and the observation that the mammalian brain relies on a deep architecture
    for visual tasks such as detection and recognition \cite{tavanaei_2019}.
    
    \section{Notable Experiments}
    A number of papers have shown promising results on SOTA recognition tasks,
    including MNIST written digit classification \cite{mozafari_2018}. As well as
    facial recognition \cite{delorme_2001}. These papers, among others use
    hand-crafted Difference of Gaussian's filters in early convolution
    layers. End-to-end trainable SNN architectures, for image processing tasks
    appear to be lacking in literature.
    
    \cite{mozafari_2018} has shown that a mixture of DoG filters, STDP, and
    reward-modulated STDP can achieve SOTA results on MNIST. The network wasn't
    end-to-end trainable, but did have a neuron-based readout, requiring no
    external classifier, such as SVM.
    
    \cite{delorme_2001} uses ROC along with some architectural and learning rule
    modifications, to better support the coding scheme. The goal of this paper
    is to show that features can be extracted from ROC encoded images after DoG
    filtering. 3x3 DoG filters were used, followed by ROC encoding, and then 32
    maps generated using an 11x11 receptive field. Connections from DoG maps to
    LIF neurons are organized in such a way to implement convolution, but still
    be trainable. If weights are updated in one region, due to training, the
    weights are simultaneously updated in the other regions. In addition, there
    is inhibition between feature maps. If a neuron fires within one map, the
    corresponding neuron is inhibited in the others. The goal was to force maps
    to learn unique features. Results were promising, and activation of LIF
    neuron maps showed selectivity for contour orientation, end-stop and blob
    types.
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%% Astrocytes Intro %%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Introduction to Astrocytes}
    Astrocytes are a type of glial cell found in mammalian brains. Their
    structure and function are still the topic of cutting edge research
    today. It is known that they are vital for normal brain functions, including
    cognition and behavior \cite{mederos_2018}. In the human brain astrocytes
    are known to tightly wrap many synapses, as well as dendrites and cell
    bodies. Since the Astrocytes engulf the synapic cleft, they are ideally
    placed to control extracellular neurotransmitter and ion
    concentrations. There is substantial evidence that they regulate
    extracellular K+, which is required for propagation of action potentials
    through neuron bodies. GABA transporters in astrocyte cell membranes serve
    to clean up neurotransmitters, and can help mitigate exitotoxcity. It should
    be noted that Astrocytes do not wrap, or even influence every synapse, and
    that their density varies widely depending on the region of the brain. More
    interesting, their morphology can change throughout life, and in response to
    other bodily functions, such as food intake \cite{mederos_2018}.

    From a computational point of view, at a high level, Astrocytes listen and
    respond to activity at the synaptic cleft. In addition, input to the
    Astrocyte (and subsequently the response) comes not only from local
    activity, but regional, including all synapses associated with a given
    astrocyte, and signals that propagate from other Astrocytes
    \cite{min_2012}. Activity at the synaptic cleft that Astrocytes are
    sensitive to include pre and post synaptic potentials, via neurotransmitter
    uptake. In general, the neurotransmitter in question is Glutamate for
    excitatatory transmission, and GABA for inhibitory. The Astrocyte will then
    respond with one or more Gliotransmitters. These include glutamate,
    D-serine, ATP or TNF-alpha. These gliotransmitters have different effects
    depending on where and when they are released.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Glutamate: When released to the pre-synaptic neuron Glu generally
        results in an increase in Probability of Release (PR). This equates to
        an increase in the weight for a computational model. At the
        post-synaptic terminal, Glutamate release results in depolarization, or
        a so called slow inward current (SIC) \cite{pitta_2016}.
      \item D-Serine: this neurochemical gates the NDMA receptors, and
        subsequently gates LTP/LTD \cite{mederos_2018}.
      \item ATP has a depressive affect, opposite to Glu \cite{mederos_2018}
      \item TNF-alpha results in an increase in the number of post-synaptic
        surface Glu receptors, and a decrease in GABA receptors
        \cite{chung_2015}.
    \end{itemize}

    Gliotransmitter release from an Astrocyte is dependent on the integration of
    synaptic activity over 100s of milliseconds (for a local response)
    \cite{pitta_2016} to 10s of seconds for a whole cell response
    \cite{mederos_2018}. This integration is mediated by a variety of input
    pathways, some of which are more thoroughly understood than others. These
    input pathways generally converge to provide an increase to intracellular
    Ca2+ concentration, within an Astrocyte. Though there is some controversy
    surround Ca2+ signaling within astrocytes \cite{mederos_2018}. Initial
    results of in vitro experiments showed a slow Ca2+ response in Astrocyte some
    following intense neuronal activity. This showed that while Astrocytes were
    active, they could not exert rapid or granular control over information flow
    at the synapse. Further, more recent research has shown that there are
    syntactically local Ca2+ responses that are much quicker and respond to
    lower levels of activity \cite{araque_2014}. The bridge between local and
    cell level response is mediated by Calcium Induced Calcium Release
    (CICR). As local activity increases beyond a certain threshold, the Calcium
    concentration causes additional Ca2+ release from the ER. This CICR
    propagates like a wave, and can reach the main cell body, other astrocyte
    processies, and even other Astrocytes \cite{manninen_2018}.

    \section{High Level Roles for Astrocytes In Biology}
    
    There are a variety of theories as to the functional role of Astrocytes.
    Some of these are speculation based on general themes of Astrocyte behavior,
    and others specific and highly grounded in experimental data.

    %% Astrocytes are Master Integrators
    Astrocytes have been shown to act as integrators of synaptic activity. Early
    studies discovered that Astrocytes become active in response to intense
    neuronal firing. Subsequent reasearch shows that this response, represented
    by Calcium concentration, was highly complex in time
    \cite{araque_2014}. This complex global response which happens on a seconds
    timescale is preceded by calcium activity in Astrocyte processes local to
    synapses. Though there isn't direct evince of this, it is thought that these
    local Ca2+ increases (sometimes called ``puffs'' or ``sparks'') propagate
    their way to the main cell body, and induces the response observed at the
    cell body \cite{araque_2014}. In this way Astrocytes can locally integrate
    neuronal activity temporally, on a 100s of milliseconds time-scale. These
    local events can then be temporally and spatially integrated on a seconds
    timescale. There is some evidence, when looking at Astrocyte mGluR
    receptors, that along a common astrocye process, there are clusters of
    receptors which form a local region. Each of these regions is associated
    with synaptic terminals, and may integrate their activity at different
    spatial and temporal time-scales as their neighbors
    \cite{pitta_2012}. Furthermore, experiments with computational models show
    that varying astrocyte modalities (as is the case in the brain) leads to
    different patterns of signal transmission. This could indicate that
    Astrocytes in different areas of the brain perform different functions
    \cite{pitta_2012}.

    %% Astrocytes facilitate long-range spatial influence
    A single Astrocyte, through its end-foot processes can influence many
    synapses simultaneously. In the brain, Astrocytes are physically distributed
    via a mechanism called contact spacing, where their end-foot processes
    connect at the periphery of an Astrocyte's domain \cite{pitta_2012}. This
    spacing is not always uniform, some micro-domains are formed favoring a
    neuron signal pathway, with adjacent astrocyte connections observed to be
    absent. One example is in the Ferret visual cortex, where astrocytes (like
    Neurons) form receptive fields on the visual input \cite{pitta_2012}.

    Signals propagate in these Astrocyte networks (ANs) in a few different
    ways. One pathway, involves Inositol Triphosphate (IP3) diffusion through
    the AN's gap junctions. Once across sufficiently high levels of IP3 cause
    CICR, and in turn Astrocyte waves. Ca2+ may also diffuse across gap
    junctions in the same way. This propagation is dubbed Calcium Waves, due to
    the wave-like nature of the propagation. In addition to the gap-junction
    mediated effects, ATP released from an Astrocyte may diffuse
    extra-cellularly, and influence other Astrocytes \cite{amiri_2013}.
    
    %% Astrocytes Modulate STP/STD
    \cite{pitta_2012} explores the pre-synaptic Glu mediated Astrocyte
    stimulation and response loop, as a mechanism for modulation of short term
    plasticity. During normal neuronal activity, the current value of the PR, as
    well as the state of the presynaptic astrocyte tend to bias a synapse
    towards STD/STP. For depression, the PR is generally above some
    threshold. With a higher PR value the NT resources at the pre-synaptic
    terminal are depleted more quickly, leading to an overall
    depression. Conversely if the PR is low the synapse will tend toward
    STP.

    %% Astrocyte Modulation of LTD/LTP
    Astrocytes have been shown to play a key role in the bio-chemical pathways
    that lead to STDP at neuronal synapses, and can gate LTD/LTP via D-Serine
    release \cite{manninen_2019}. Beyond passively participating in the normal
    STDP, astrocytes may gate it's activity, or reverse the polarity,
    implementing anti-STDP \cite{min_2012}. In addition, Glutamate released by
    astrocytes in response to pre and post-synaptic activity may strech or shift
    the traditional STDP curve in both experimental results, and computational
    models \cite{pitta_2016}.

    Astrocytes can modulate the concentration of their surface glu transporters,
    this in turn modulates the level of glu spill-over, beyond the synapse. This
    in-turn increases the excitability (depolarizing neurons partially towards
    firing) post-synapse for a local region of synapses. Astrocytes may also
    respond to glutamate activity (as sensed by transporter uptake) by releasing
    more glutamate, or by releasing ATP, based on signaling frequency. Within
    the Hippocampus, it has been observed that GABA release from a pre-synaptic
    neuron can be taken up by GAT-1 and GAT-3 transporters on an Astrocyte's
    surface. This leads to an increase in Na+/$Ca^{2+}$ within the Astrocyte,
    and the eventual release of ATP. ATP acts as an ihibitor, down-regulating
    excitatory transmission \cite{mederos_2018}.
    
    Astrocytes also play a major role in Spike-Dependent plasticity (STDP), mediating
    LTD/LTP at the synapse and gating it. Both LTD and LTP are controlled by the
    NMDAR receptor, with the distinction between depression and potentiation
    being the presence of K+ ions, indicating post-synaptic
    depolarization. Figure \ref{fig:astro_plastic} shows this pathway for
    LTD. When a post-synaptic depolarization is followed closely by pre-synaptic
    depolarization a signaling pathway proceeds, leading to glutamate release by
    the astroctye, which in turn triggers NDMAR receptors in the pre-synaptic
    neuron. The influx of ions leads to a decrease in pre-synaptic
    neurotransmitter release probability (through some mechanism not described
    here) \cite{min_2012}.

    \section{Biochemistry Inspires Computational Models of Various Pathways}
    Over the last 30 years there have been experiments and study surrounding the
    role of Astrocytes in the mammalian brain. This research has lead to the
    identification of a variety of signaling pathways, along with some
    quantitative data. These new insights in the neuroscience field, have lead
    to a wave of computational models, which attempt to either mimic
    Neuron-Astrocyte interactions, or extract some computational benefit by a
    simplified, but still very bio-plausible model. The first clue to Astrocyte
    involvement in computation was the observation of Glutamate released from
    the pre-synaptic neuron, and subsequent increase in $Ca_2^+$ concentration
    within astrocyte cell bodies and foot processes \cite{manninen_2018}. Around
    2010, new experimental data emerged from in-vivo studies, which furthered
    the functional understanding of Astrocyte signaling
    \cite{manninen_2018}. Some pathways are responsible for modulating
    plasticity while other lead to transient changes in neuron dynamics. A key
    step in developing a computational model, that captures the key features
    involved in information processing, is understanding the biological
    pathways.

    %% TODO: Add pathway figure
    
    Figure \ref{fig:astro_pathways} shows the possible signaling pathways at the
    Tripartied synapse. Each pathway has some underlying research into the
    behavior at that pathway, either in vitro or in vivo. This experimental data
    has led to a variety of computational models, which share a common theme but
    differ in complexity, level of bio-realism, and computational efficiency.


    \subsection{Neuron-Astrocyte Pathways - Presynaptic to Astrocyte}

    One of the first experimental observations of Astrocytes was a transient
    increase in Ca2+ in response to high levels of neuron activity. One of the
    main pathways mediating this response is the Pre-synatic Glu
    pathway. Excitatory cortical neurons release Glu in response to input
    stimulus. Glu binds to the G-couple mGluR receptors receptors on the surface
    of an astrocyte. This sets in motion a cascade involving the IP3 second
    messenger, which ultimately leads to Ca2+ release in the astrocyte soma
    \cite{pitta_2012}. IP3 induced Ca2+ release from the ER leads to a rapid
    breakdown of IP3, creating a kind of local calcium spike. This Ca2+
    concentration can integrate within the cell soma, but does degrade due to
    the activity of pumps at ER surface \cite{pitta_2012}.

    To model this \cite{pitta_2009} uses a three variable approach, which
    extends the Liâ€“Rinzel model with bio-realistic IP3 dynamics. In general Ca
    concentration (when considering the IP3 mediated pre-synaptic pathway only)
    is dependant on two internal activites, and one external. Internally, there
    is a $J_{leak}$ factor, describing a differential based leak from the ER
    into the Astrocyte Cytosol. To override this leak, and maintain the
    differential, SERCA pumps move Ca2+ into the ER. This is noted by
    $J_{pump}$. $J_{chan}$ Accounts for the flux of Ca2+ from the ER into the
    cytoplasm due to IP3 levels, or CICR, depending on the Ca2+ concentration
    \cite{pitta_2009}. In this case IP3 levels are a function of glutamate
    release from the pre-synaptic neuron.  \cite{pitta_2016} extends this model,
    including the Glio-transmitter release from the Astrocyte in response to
    Ca2+ transients. In their work a spike of GT is released (similar to a
    neuron) when Ca2+ concentration reaches some threshold. It should be noted,
    that the IP3/Ca2+ spiking response (IP3 -> Ca release -> IP3 cleanup + Ca
    cleanup) is independent of the GT release, meaning there can be
    sub-threshold Calcium spikes).

    The above outlines the common theme for presynaptic Astrocyte
    modulation. The general form of the pathway outlined above is shared by
    \cite{postnov_2009}, and \cite{wade_2011}. Though there are variations among
    modeling approach which will be covered in further detail.

    
    \subsection{Neuron-Astrocyte Pathways - Postsynaptic to Astrocyte}
    Another common pathway that is explored both in neuroscience and
    computationally is the ``fast'' post-synaptic pathway \cite{bassam_2015}. In
    this pathway, the post-synaptic neuron fires, and subsequently releases
    K+. This K+ spillover is quickly shuttled into the Astrocyte, and causes
    depolarization. Voltage-gated channels on the ER then lead to Ca2+ release
    into the cytoplasm. It is considered fast pathway, because the effect of K+
    is direct, vs. the pre-synaptic pathway involving a second messenger
    \cite{bassam_2015}. The astrocyte to post-synaptic pathway

    
    \subsection{Calcium and Other Messenger Dynamics}
    Calcium, IP3 and K+ are the main substances involved in signaling pathways
    within the Astrocyte. What isn't immediately obvious unless one is paying
    close attention to the modeling (or more bio-realistiic) equations, is that
    there are spikes and thresholds within these internal Astrocyte
    concentrations. Neuroscience experiments involving monitoring of Astrocyes
    revealed oscillations, which are more intense and propagate further
    depending on Activity. These oscillations are the consequence of non-linear
    negative feedback, leading to fast cleanup, and spike-like behavior
    \cite{postnov_2009}. The second messenger IP3 has a similar behavior, with a
    threshold and tanh (with decay factor) resulting in spike-like behavior
    \cite{postnov_2009}.

    \cite{wade_2011} cites similar behavior, except it is the output GT release
    that exhibits spiking behavior, where there isn't spiking observed in the
    calcium. In this model, like with \cite{postnov_2009} there is a threshold
    gating GT release.

    \cite{pitta_2009} introduces the AM/FM variants on the $J_{pump} - J_{chan}
    - J_{leak}$ model, which exhibits spiking and non-spiking calcium dynamics,
    depending on choice of parameter. This is the same model outlined in \cite{wade_2011}.

    It is also well established that the IP3 pathway is operates
    on a slower time-scale, then more direct pathways such as ATP or K+
    \cite{postnov_2009}, \cite{bassam_2015}.


    \section{Evolution of Astrocyte Models}
    \cite{manninen_2018} provides a very insightful review of astrocyte models
    from 1995 until about 2017, and, more importantly an analysis on the origin
    of models for many papers considered. In this work, four different core
    Neuron-Astrocyte models have been identified in the literature over the
    time-period considered. These astrocyte models are modified throughout the
    works, to show different effects.

    \subsection{Foundational Astrocyte Models}
    \cite{manninen_2018} Grouped models from early works that appeared to
    precede many other models (qualitatively) through 2017: One of these groups
    consists of models defined by De Young and Keizer (1992)a and Li and Rinzel
    (1994). De Young and Keizer like models are characterized by a

    \subsection{Astrocyte Networks}
    Beyond their association with neurons, Astrocytes also form their own
    networks, in the form of gap junctions. Due to the nature of these
    connections (a protein spanning two cell walls) only physically adjacent
    astrocytes can form connections. Astrocytes don't have long-reaching
    projections like the axons of neurons. Astrocyte networks have been shown to
    form non-overlapping groups, with limited, but present connectivity between
    groups. These groups generally consist of between 2-10 astrocytes. This
    raises the question, for simulation, how are these connections
    initialized. \cite{postnov_2009} proposes a method for forming these
    networks during simulation. The approach is a recursive technique, and can
    generate connections between astrocytes while respecting their need for
    close proximity. The algorithm is as follows.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item From the center of each astrocyte, produce a random number between
          m and n of branches pointing outward in uniformly random directions.
        \item If any branch either intersects another of the same astrocyte, or
          is closer to another astrocyte than its ancestor (could be its
          astrocyte, or another branch).\
        \item For any surviving branches generate a random number of next-level
          branches between 1 and k.
        \item repeat 2, 3 until a maximum branching level $N_max$ is reached.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \section{Astrocyte Mediated Effects In the Literature}
    \subsection{GT Release From Astrocyte}
    To signal back to neurons, Astrocytes release various gliotransmitters,
    which were outlined above. In general, this release is dependent on the
    concentration of Ca2+ local to the synapse. Input pathways converge with
    Ca2+ concentration, and then divergent effects are observed via the release
    of multiple gliotransmitters.

    ATP release from astrocytes can travel between itersiticial spaces and
    effect synaptic transmission at physically local
    synapses. \cite{postnov_2009} explores the phenomenon of hetero-synaptic
    suppression, which is mediated by Glu and ATP release. Their experiment
    depends on an existing computational model, with some modifications to
    suport ATP release. A synapse local to an Astrocyte is potentiated in the
    short term via glutamate release. Over a longer time-scale, ATP is released
    from the Astrocyte and diffuses to a neighboring synapse, decreasing
    synaptic PR. This results in the signal generated at N1 is passed through to
    the downstream neuron, where the N3 signal is suppressed.

    \subsection{Facilitation of LTP/LTD}
    Astrocytes are believed to facilitate, or even implement LPT/LTD in
    biological synapses. Retrograde signals responsible for synaptic PR changes
    are picked up by Astrocytes, and result in the release of Glu and D-Serine,
    which act on pre-synaptic NMDA receptors. Activation of these receptors
    leads to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength \cite{min_2012}.

    \section{Propagation of Astrocyte Signals Internally}
    Early research into Astrocyte behavior showed cell-wide Ca2+ transients in
    response to intense activity, which would in some cases propagate to
    neighboring cells. \cite{manninen_2018} reports that it wasn't until around
    2010 that pharmacological tools became precise enough to discover smaller
    variations in Ca2+ at Astrocyte processes, in response to lower levels of
    neuronal activity. These smaller variations are thought to be integrated,
    and lead to a larger cell-level Ca2+ response, though there is not direct
    evidence of this \cite{araque_2014}. In addition, the mechanism thought to
    trigger the switch from local to global responses is Calcium-Induced Calcium
    release (CICR) which is the mechanism responsible for spike-like behavior
    within Astrocyes.
    
    Astrocytes also form their own networks, separate from the connections of
    neurons. Gap junctions between cells can pass various molecules including
    ions and secondary messengers. Gap junctions are not evenly distributed, or
    random, meaning they form meaningful connections between specific
    astrocytes. These networks appear to form non-overlapping territories, where
    groups are interconnected, but distinct from other
    groups \cite{mederos_2018}. The shapes of Astrocyte networks are varied,
    and in the visual cortex consist of between 2 and 10 Astrocytes. In
    addition, Astrocyes are generally not found un-coupled in the brain, further
    supporting the significance of Astrocyte networks \cite{postnov_2009}. The
    specific molecules that generally diffuse across gap junctions are IP3 and
    Ca2+, with only IP3 being modeled in some cases \cite{pitta_2012}. In any
    case the effect is generally described as excitable, regardless of the
    molecule that diffuses \cite{gordleeva_2021}, \cite{pitta_2012},
    \cite{postnov_2009}.
    
    The functional role, and information processing implications of Astrocyte
    networks isn't yet well understood. There are a few consequences of
    Astrocyte networks that have been observed and modeled however. First, these
    networks provide additional pathways for Calcium waves to propagate, and in
    some cases form cycles, where astrocyte waves return to their place of
    origin. In addition, under intense neural activity, ANs support far reaching
    synaptic modulation \cite{postnov_2009}. There have been attempts at
    modeling astrocyte network, with variying degrees of
    complexity. \cite{postnov_2009} developed a random procedural algorithm for
    generating a 2D bio-plausible Astrocyte network. In this case some
    experimental results were reproduced, such as the far-reaching propagation
    of high intensity firing, and Calcium waves. Other works, such as
    \cite{gordleeva_2021} employ Astrocyte networks to support working memory.

    \section{Theories on High-level Functions of Astrocytes in Biological Brains}
    
    It is important to speculate on some higher level functional roles of
    Astrocytes, even when the availability of concrete data isn't sufficent to
    analyze these speculations. In general astrocytes can modulate synapse
    excitability through a variety of mechanisms, and modulate synaptic
    plasticity through the release of glutamate and D-serine. There is evidence
    that astrocytes modulate LTP/LTD based on external inputs and internal
    state, this could provide a mechanism for reward-modulated STDP
    \cite{min_2012}. In addition It has been shown that smaller learning rates
    coupled with STDP lead to better memory, when presented with test and
    challenge inputs \cite{van-rossum_2012}. Astrocytes modulate learning at a
    regional level, providing an opportunity for one portion of the network to
    learn, while another retains what it learned previously. In addition to
    regional gating (or more fine-grained modulation) of learning, Astrocytes,
    through local differences in response (within the same cell) can bias a
    network of spiking neurons to learn a particular function, or class of
    functions.

    In addition to plasticity, Astroctes can modulate the synaptic tone, or
    basal level of excitation. It has been suggested that this effect, coupled
    with inter-astrocyte communication can "activate" a region of a network,
    possibly choosing it as most important for the given input. In essence,
    Astrocytes would implement a context switch \cite{min_2012},
    \cite{gordleeva_2021}. Another result of this regional excitation is
    synchronization. As Astrocytes lower the threshold for post-synaptic firing,
    pre-synaptic potentials that are disparate in time, or strength can result
    in synchronized post-synaptic firing. This effect could be important in a
    variety of situations, but one of particular note is STDP. Since STDP is
    very sensitive to relative spike timing, having synchronized inputs (and not
    penalizing an input for being ever so slightly late) would result in better
    stability.

    Given Astrocyte's level of connectedness with neurons, and the formation of
    Astrocyte networks, there is a distinct opportunity for information transfer
    across long distances without the need for supporting neural
    connections. It is thought that these pathways underlie some of the
    coordinated activity between neural circuits from different brain
    regions. Some researchers even claim Astrocytes for the basis of human
    consciousness.
